A connection stream is a multiplex of 3 line streams:

1. Command stream. Commands are executed in the same order as they are sent.
  Execution of each command ends with 'ack' or 'fail' (or 'fail <message>')
  <- <command>
  -> <command output>
  -> 'ack' / 'fail'

2. Message stream. Messages should be considered unsolicited and (mostly) informational
  -> '+' <info-message>

3. State changes. Messages on this channel are unsolicited and reflect client state changes.
  -> '$' <new state>
