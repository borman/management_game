A connection stream is a multiplex of 3 line streams. Only command stream is
synchronous, all other streams are asynchronous:

1. Command stream. Commands are executed in the same order as they are sent.
  Execution of each command ends with 'ack' or 'fail' (or 'fail <message>')
  <- <command>
  -> <command output>
  -> 'ack' / 'fail'

2. Game data stream. These messages provide game information
  -> '+' <info-message class> [<info-message args>]

3. State changes. These messages reflect client state changes.
  -> '$' <new state>

4. Text message stream. These messages only contain some textual hints for user.
  -> '>' <message author> <message>
